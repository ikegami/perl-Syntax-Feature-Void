=head1 NAME

Syntax::Feature::Void - Provides the C<void> operator to force void context.


=head1 VERSION

Version 1.7.0


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use syntax qw( void );

    sub f {
        void g();
    }

The above is functionally equivalent to the following:

    sub f {
        g();
        return;
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Syntax::Feature::Void is a lexically-scoped pragma that
provides the C<void> operator to force void context.
Not that anyone needs that.

This module serves as a demonstration of the ability to
add keywords to the Perl language using
L<C<PL_keyword_plugin>|perlapi/PL_keyword_plugin>.


=head2 C<< use syntax qw( void ); >>

=head2 C<< use Syntax::Feature::Void; >>

Enables the use of C<void> until the end of the current lexical scope.


=head2 C<< no syntax qw( void ); >>

=head2 C<< no Syntax::Feature::Void; >>

Restores the standard behaviour of C<void> (a sub call) until the
end of the current lexical scope.


=head2 C<< void EXPR >>

Evalutes EXPR in void context.
